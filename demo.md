This document explains artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. 

Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming.

Natural language processing helps computers understand human language.

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks.

Deep learning uses multi-layered neural networks to model complex patterns in data.
